1.disease and symptoms
                data
                    pre data provided from internet
                    + renforced learning from users
                preprocessing
                            now looks in raw file for the data to be processed and saves in the
                            diseases and symptoms clean
                training model
                            it gets the data from the diseases and symptoms clean
                            and creats the train model in the model directory as lgbm_model_clean.pkl
                Testing model prediction
                            it launches the pre train model from lgbm_model_clean.pkl and works with the correct
                            symptoms as the data set is scarce
2.Chat bot
                data
                     the strater data is generated and place in the Chat_bot_verified_vocab_and_user_input directory
                     + can learn new words from users
                preprocessing
                            now looks in raw file for the data in the Chat_bot_verified_vocab_and_user_input
                            directory i.e to be processed and saves in the chat_bot_clean
                training model
                              it gets the data from the chat_bot_clean
                            and create the train model in the model directory as naive_bayes_model.pkl
                Testing model run
                            Conservation can now be held regarding the symptoms and disease
3.Logger
           this is added to train the user input data where it cross checks the data with the varified health
           sector


29/11/2025
update
1.Added a pipeline to handle all the task when the code is run
2.Logger now controls the when to run the preprocessing and train for both the deseases and chat bot * old logger file is stored in another log directory in bin file
3. chat_bot_preprocessing contains a new code in dormaint condition which fetches new predicted disease symptoms from WHO
4. run_chatbot has the code to give the WHO precaution fo the specific disaeses ( Not yet fully tested)
5. Chat bot needed a way to enable logger trigger which is done the pipe line also need one so it is also added.
    in both the chat bot and the piple when run i displays to add new disease typr "Do you know 'type Disease here'"
    have added *common cold as a test sample
6. now the current accuracy for training model is 67%, 11/30/2025 70% and the predicted is 52%
7.all the lgms has been updated to work with each other
8. have use a tuning scrip to find the best setting for the disease and symptoms train model


 to be fixed(done)
  1.pipeline will run in to error if the chat bot is updates and when reverted to old code it still works ( Fixed)
  2. fix chat bot disease prediction as the dieases prideced is not correcerd when compared to pedicted_lgbm is run ( Fixed)
  3. need to check disease and symptom code as it cant predict respiratory track infection like it used to ( Fixed)
  4. Check if the logger is getting data for new disease (Fixed)

update 11/30/2025
1. now the logger is working as intended it goes to sleep and wakes up after 30 mis to check if there is new unverified data
   and a quick trigger "verify now" to verify it quickly
2. there has been a new update for the run chatbot which handles disease with imilar csymptoms * this has ot been implemented
   and has been left out for future update
to be fixed
1. chatbot is triggering autometicaly when ever new word has been entered
2.check / remove the disease verified source from the "raw/Chat_bot_verified_vocab_and_user_input"

 to be added
1. chat bot to give precaution using the who database with regard to the disease predict or just casual info by about a diseae by user(Done)
2. need to test if the logger i.e training by user is working (Done)
3. how to run all this code one time( Done)
4. hand shaking with the chat bot and the diseases and symptoms to give the user the correct disease (Done)
5. need to design the web features to logging in from website i.e web interface
6. how to save the project for carry
7. need to add separate csv for training user input chat dataset
8. is it possible for the user to get symptoms from disease and disease from symptoms in the disease and symptoms file(Done)
