cholera,WHO,"Preventing and controlling cholera involves a combination of strengthening surveillance, improving water, sanitation and hygiene, increasing risk communication and community engagement, improving access to quality treatment and implementing oral cholera vaccine campaigns.","Cholera surveillance should be part of an integrated disease surveillance system. This includes timely reporting, data analysis, interpretation and sharing of information from local to global levels. Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are useful for early detection of probable cholera outbreaks, but confirmation requires laboratory testing by culture, seroagglutination or polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",Countries at risk or affected by cholera should strengthen their surveillance systems according to the revised Global Taskforce on Cholera Control (GTFCC) recommendations to quickly detect and respond to outbreaks.
endocarditis,N/A,No specific online advice found. Please consult a doctor.,,
zika virus,WHO,There is no specific treatment available for Zika virus infection or disease.,"People with symptoms such as rash, fever or joint pain should get plenty of rest, drink fluids, and treat symptoms with antipyretics and/or analgesics. If a specific diagnosis cannot be made and dengue cannot be ruled out, patients should be treated as if they have dengue, according to standardized clinical guidelines. This includes avoidance of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs until dengue virus infections are ruled out because of bleeding risk. If symptoms worsen, patients should seek medical care and advice.","Pregnant women living in areas with Zika transmission or who develop symptoms of Zika virus infection should seek medical attention for laboratory testing, information, counselling and other clinical care."
yellow fever,WHO,"There is no specific anti-viral treatment. Clinical care remains mostly supportive, with the 2025 clinical management guidelines providing a protocolized approach. The two anti-virals that can be given , sofosbuvir and monoclonal antibody TY014, are recommended exclusively in research settings(3).","Supportive care includes rest and hydration; management of liver and kidney failure, and fever; and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. Patients may be managed at home, hospitalized, or referred for emergency care depending on severity. Jaundice is an indication of severe disease, justifying hospitalization, often in an intensive care unit.","Diagnosis is challenging, especially early on when clinical manifestations are nonspecific. Severe cases may resemble malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis, other haemorrhagic fevers such as dengue, and poisoning."
