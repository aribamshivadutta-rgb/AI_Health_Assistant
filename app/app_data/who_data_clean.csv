malaria,WHO,Malaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines. Talk to a doctor about taking medicines such as chemoprophylaxis before travelling to areas where malaria is common.,Lower the risk of getting malaria by avoiding mosquito bites:,"Use mosquito nets when sleeping in places where malaria is present.Use mosquito repellents (containing DEET, IR3535 or Icaridin) after dusk.Use coils and vaporizers. Wear protective clothing.Use window screens.",Vector control is a vital component of malaria control and elimination strategies as it is highly effective in preventing infection and reducing disease transmission. The 2 core interventions are insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS).,
cholera,WHO,"Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease that can be fatal within hours if not treated. Quick access to treatment is crucial.Researchers estimate that there are 1.3 to 4.0 million cases and 21 000 to 143 000 deaths from cholera worldwide each year (1).Most people with cholera have no or mild symptoms and can be treated with oral rehydration solution. Severe cases need intravenous fluids, oral rehydration solution and antibiotics.Population’s access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene (WASH) is essential to prevent cholera.The oral cholera vaccine (OCV) can help prevent and control cholera.","Cholera is an acute diarrheal infection caused by consuming food or water contaminated with the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. It is a global public health threat and indicates inequity and lack of social and economic development. Access to safe water, basic sanitation and hygiene is essential to prevent cholera and other waterborne diseases.","Most people with cholera have mild or moderate diarrhoea and can be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS). However, the disease can progress rapidly, so starting treatment quickly is vital to save lives. Patients with severe disease need intravenous fluids, ORS and antibiotics.",Countries need strong epidemiological and laboratory surveillance to swiftly detect and monitor outbreaks and guide responses.,
zika virus,WHO,"Zika virus is primarily transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes, which bite mostly during the day.Most people with Zika virus infection do not develop symptoms. When symptoms occur, they include rash, fever, conjunctivitis, muscle and joint pain, malaise and headache that last for 2–7 days. No vaccine is yet available for the prevention or treatment of Zika virus infection.Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause infants to be born with microcephaly smaller than normal head size and other congenital malformations, as well as preterm birth and miscarriage.Zika virus infection is associated with Guillain-Barré syndrome, neuropathy and myelitis in adults and children.In February 2016, WHO declared Zika-related microcephaly a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC). The causal link between the Zika virus and congenital malformations was confirmed, and the PHEIC declaration was lifted in November 2016.Although cases of Zika virus disease declined globally from 2017 onwards, transmission persists at low levels in several countries in the Americas and in some countries in Asia and Africa, where sporadic outbreaks have also been documented.","Zika virus is a mosquito-borne virus that was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in a Rhesus macaque monkey, followed by evidence of infection and disease in humans in other African countries in the 1950s.","From the 1960s to the 1980s, sporadic human infections were detected across Africa and Asia. However, since 2007, outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.","During outbreaks over the last decade, Zika virus infection was found to be associated with increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome. When Zika virus emerged in the Americas, with a large epidemic in Brazil in 2015, an association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly (smaller than normal head size) was first describe. Similar findings were observed in French Polynesia upon retrospective review. From February to November 2016, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) regarding microcephaly, other neurological disorders and Zika virus, and the causal link between Zika virus and congenital malformations was confirmed soon thereafter (1,2). Outbreaks of Zika virus disease were identified throughout most of the Americas and in other regions with established Aedes aegypti mosquito populations. Infections were also detected in travellers from active transmission areas and sexual transmission was confirmed as an alternate route of Zika virus infection.",
